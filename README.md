## Aufgabe

In this repository, you will find 3 jupyter notebooks, which use Python to complete
the exercises.

**01_BIL_to_Histogram:**
This notebook shows how BIL data is read and transformed to a histogram. All the 
necessary steps to complete the task are annotated.

**02_Lincoln_hist_corrleation***
This notebook reads the Lincoln image and prints the table of values as well as
a rendered image.

**03_image_vs_random_histogr_comparison:**
This notebook loads a numeric pixel value image, as well as a same-size randomly
generated image. In order to show that histograms can show that an image is "realistic",
histograms for both images are created and compared.

Launching Binder after new commit might take a while, since the docker needs to be rebuilt by MyBinder.
Feel free to experiment within the MyBinder Notebooks, one-time personal instances are created for you
when you launch it via the button.
