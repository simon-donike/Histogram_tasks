[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/simon-donike/bil_histogram/master)

## Aufgabe

In this repository, you will find 3 jupyter notebooks, which use Python to complete
the exercises.

**01_BIL_to_Histogram:**
This notebook shows how BIL data is read and transformed to a histogram. All the 
necessary steps are to complete the task are annotated.

**02_Lincoln_hist_corrleation***
This notebook reads the Lincoln image and prints the table of values as well as
a rendered image.

**03_image_vs_random_histogr_comparison:**
This notebook loads a numeric pixel value image, as well as a same-size randomly
generated image. In order to show that histograms can show that an image is "realistic",
histograms for both images are created and compared.
